## Implementing Cloud Storage using Amazon S3 and EBS

**Objectives:**
  - Create and configure Amazon S3 buckets with different storage classes
  - Upload, manage, and access objects in S3
  - Configure S3 bucket policies and static website hosting
  - Understand block storage using EBS volumes
  - Compare object storage (S3) vs. block storage (EBS)

**Theory:**

Cloud storage removes the need for on-premises storage infrastructure. AWS provides multiple storage services suited to different use cases.

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
  * Object storage with 99.999999999% durability. Data is stored as objects inside buckets. Supported storage classes include S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent Tiering, and S3 Glacier for archival. Common use cases include backups, media hosting, static websites, and data lakes.

**Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
  * Block level storage volumes attached to EC2 instances. Functions like a virtual hard disk. Supports SSD types (gp3, io2) and HDD types (st1, sc1).

**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):**
  * A managed NFS file system that can be shared across multiple EC2 instances.

S3 uses a flat namespace with buckets acting as containers and objects as the stored files. A unique key identifies each object. S3 also supports versioning, lifecycle policies, encryption, and access control.

**Procedure:**

**Part A: Amazon S3**

**Step 1:** Navigate to S3 and click "Create Bucket". Configure the following:
  - AWS Region: US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1
  - Bucket name: `cloud-lab-storage-<your-class-roll-number>` (must be globally unique)
  - Object Ownership: ACLs disabled
  - Leave "Block all public access" checked for now
  - Bucket Versioning: Disable

**Step 2:** Click "Create Bucket" and open the newly created bucket.

---
**Step 3:** Upload files to the bucket:
  - Click "Upload" and add files (for example, index.html, an image, or a PDF)
  - Note that the storage class defaults to "S3 Standard"

---
**Step 4:** Enable Versioning:
  - Bucket > Properties > Bucket Versioning > Enable
  - Upload the same file again with modified content (Compress the image using https://tinypng.com/index.html & upload again)
  - Toggle "Show versions" to view the stored versions

---
**Step 5:** Configure Static Website Hosting:
  - Bucket > Properties > Static website hosting > Enable
  - Index document: `index.html`
  - Error document: `error.html`

---
**Step 6:** Update the bucket policy to allow public read access for the website:
  - Bucket > Permissions > Uncheck "Block all public access" > Confirm
  - Add the following bucket policy:

```json name=bucket-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cloud-lab-storage-<your-unique-id>/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

**Step 7:** Create an `index.html` file with the following content:

```html name=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Cloud Storage Lab</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to S3 Static Website Hosting!</h1>
  <p>This page is served from Amazon S3.</p>
  <p>Full Name: Samriddhi College</p>
  <p>Roll Number: 502</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Upload the file and open the S3 website endpoint URL in a browser.

---
**Step 8:** Configure a Lifecycle Rule:
  - Bucket > Management > Create lifecycle rule
  - Rule Name: `TransitionToGlacierExpireInYear`
  - Prefix: Limit the rule to objects in a folder or specific path (2026/uploads/)
  - Tags: Glacier
  - Rule: Transition current versions of objects between storage classes. (Transition objects to S3 Glacier after 90 days, expire after 365 days)
    - Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier), Days after object creation: 365

**Results:**
  - S3 bucket created with versioning, lifecycle policies, and static website hosting configured
  - Static website successfully hosted on S3
  - EBS volume created, attached to an EC2 instance, formatted, and mounted
  - Both object storage (S3) and block storage (EBS) functionality were demonstrated

---

**Discussion and Conclusion:**

This lab covered two core AWS storage types. Amazon S3 provides highly durable, scalable object storage suited to unstructured data, backups, and static content delivery. Versioning protects against accidental deletion, and lifecycle rules reduce costs by moving data to cheaper storage tiers over time. EBS provides block level storage that acts as a persistent virtual disk for EC2 instances, making it a better fit for databases and file systems that require low latency access. Knowing when to use object storage versus block storage is a practical skill for designing cloud architectures that are both efficient and cost effective.
