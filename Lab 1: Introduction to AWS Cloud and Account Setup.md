# Getting Started with AWS Cloud Platform

---

**Objectives:**
  - Understand the AWS Cloud ecosystem and its global infrastructure
  - Create and configure an AWS Free Tier account
  - Explore the AWS Management Console and core service categories
  - Relate AWS services to cloud computing characteristics (on-demand, scalability, pay as you go)

---

**Theory:**

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, and software) over the internet. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the leading cloud platform, offering 200+ services across data centers worldwide. The evolution of cloud computing progressed from mainframes to client server architecture, then to virtualization, and finally to cloud computing. Key characteristics defined by NIST include:

  1. **On-demand self service** – Users provision resources without human intervention
  2. **Broad network access** – Services accessible over the internet
  3. **Resource pooling** – Multi tenant model serving multiple consumers
  4. **Rapid elasticity** – Resources scale up or down automatically
  5. **Measured service** – Pay per use billing model

AWS organizes its infrastructure into **Regions** (geographic areas) and **Availability Zones** (isolated data centers within a region), providing high availability and fault tolerance. The AWS Free Tier allows new users to explore services at no cost for 12 months.

**Procedure:**

**Step 1:** Open a web browser and navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

**Step 2:** Click **"Create a Free Account"** and provide:
  - Email address
  - AWS account name
  - A strong root password

**Step 3:** Provide contact information (select "Personal" as the account type) and enter a payment method (credit or debit card for identity verification; no charges apply under the Free Tier).


**Step 4:** Complete identity verification via phone or SMS.


**Step 5:** Select the **"Basic Support - Free"** plan and click **Complete Sign Up**.

**Step 6:** Sign in to the **AWS Management Console** at [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com)


**Step 7:** Explore the Console Dashboard:
- Locate the **Region selector** in the top right corner and select the nearest region
- Browse service categories: Compute, Storage, Database, Networking, Security

> *Screenshot: AWS Management Console dashboard showing service categories [Optional]*


**Step 8:** Navigate to **AWS Billing Dashboard** and open **Free Tier Usage** to view available free services and their usage limits.

**Step 9:** Open **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** and create an IAM user with admin permissions. Using an IAM user instead of the root account is a standard security practice.
- Go to IAM > Users > Add User
- Username: `lab-admin`
- Enable "AWS Management Console access"
- Attach policy: `AdministratorAccess`

> *Screenshot: IAM user creation with policy attached [Optional]*


**Step 10:** Enable **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** on the root account:
- IAM > Dashboard > "Activate MFA on your root account"

> *Screenshot: MFA setup completion [Optional]*

---

**Results:**
  - AWS Free Tier account successfully created and configured
  - AWS Management Console explored with an understanding of service categories
  - IAM user created with appropriate permissions
  - MFA enabled on the root account
  - AWS Regions and Availability Zones structure identified

**Discussion and Conclusion:**

This lab covered the foundational setup of the AWS cloud platform, which reflects all five NIST characteristics of cloud computing. The Management Console provides on-demand self service provisioning. The global infrastructure of Regions and Availability Zones demonstrates resource pooling and broad network access. The Free Tier model reflects a measured service approach. Rapid elasticity will be observed in subsequent labs. Creating a dedicated IAM user and enabling MFA on the root account follows the principle of least privilege, which is a core security practice in any cloud environment.
