# Implementing Cloud Database Services Using Amazon RDS and DynamoDB

---

**Objectives**

 - Deploy a managed relational database using Amazon RDS
 - Create and interact with a NoSQL database using DynamoDB
 - Understand the Database as a Service model in cloud environments
 - Configure database security, automated backups, and monitoring
 - Compare relational (SQL) and NoSQL database services on AWS

---

**Theory**

Cloud databases remove the burden of managing physical hardware, applying patches, scheduling backups, and manually scaling. AWS provides fully managed database services designed for different workload types.

**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** 

It supports managed SQL engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Aurora. It handles automated backups, OS and engine patching, and Multi-AZ failover for high availability. Read replicas can be added to distribute read traffic and improve performance.

**Amazon DynamoDB** 

It is a fully managed NoSQL database that stores data in key value and document formats. It delivers single digit millisecond response times at any scale and operates serverlessly, scaling capacity up or down automatically. Billing is either per request or based on provisioned throughput. It is widely used for high-throughput workloads such as gaming leaderboards, IoT data ingestion, and mobile application backends.

Both services are foundational components in cloud application architecture. They provide persistent data storage for web services, scientific computing, and business systems. In multi tenant environments, data isolation between tenants is a key security concern, enforced through encryption, network controls, and access policies.

**Procedure**

**Part A: Amazon RDS (Relational Database)**

**Step 1: Create an RDS Database Instance**

 1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to **Aurora and RDS** using the search bar.
 2. In the left sidebar, click **Databases**, then click **Create database**.
 3. Under **Engine type**, select **MySQL**.
 4. Under **Choose a database creation method**, select **Full configuration**.
 5. Under **Templates**, select **Dev/Test**.
 6. Under **Availability and durability**, select **Single-AZ DB instance deployment (1 instance)**.
 7. Under **Settings**, configure the following:
    - DB instance identifier: `cloud-lab-db`
    - Master username: `admin`
    - Credentials management: select **Self managed**
    - Master password: create a strong password (e.g., `Admin12345!`) and note it down
    - Confirm master password: re-enter the same password
 8. Under **Instance configuration**:
    - Check **Burstable classes (includes t classes)**
    - Instance type: select **db.t3.micro**
 9. Under **Storage**:
    - Storage type: **gp2**
    - Allocated storage: `20` GiB
    - Expand **Additional storage configuration** > uncheck **Enable storage autoscaling**
 10. Under **Connectivity**:
     - Compute resource: **Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource**
     - VPC: **Default VPC**
     - Public access: **Yes**
     - VPC security group: select **Create new**
     - New VPC security group name: `DB-security-group`
     - Availability Zone: **No preference**
    
 11. Scroll down to **Monitoring**:
     - Uncheck **Enable Performance Insights**
     - Uncheck **Enable Enhanced Monitoring**
    
 12. Scroll down and expand **Additional configuration**:
     - Backup retention period: **7 days**
     - Choose a preferred backup window (Start time and Duration)
     - Uncheck **Enable delete protection**
     - Leave all other settings as the default
     
 13. Click **Create database**. You will be automatically redirected to the **Databases** dashboard. Monitor the status of `cloud-lab-db`; it will initially show **Creating**. Wait **5 to 10 minutes** until the status changes to **Available** (shown in green). Once available, click on `cloud-lab-db` to open the instance details.

 14. Click the **Connectivity & security** tab and copy the **Endpoint** address (it looks like: `cloud-lab-db.xxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`). Save this; you will need it in Step 3.

sudo yum install mysql* -y
```
3. Connect to your RDS instance (replace `<rds-endpoint>` with the endpoint you copied in Step 2):
```bash
mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u admin -p
```
4. Enter your password when prompted. You should see the `mysql>` prompt if the connection is successful.


**Step 4: Create a Database, Table, and Insert Records**

 - Once connected at the `mysql>` prompt, run the following SQL commands one by one:
```sql
DROP DATABASE your_database_name;
USE cloud_lab;
```
 - Create the table
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    course VARCHAR(100),
    enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE)
);
```
 - Insert the records:
```sql

INSERT INTO students (name, email, course) VALUES
('Natasha', 'natasha@example.com', 'Cloud Computing'),
('David', 'david@example.com', 'Cloud Security'),
('Kamal', 'kamal@example.com', 'Virtualization');

SELECT * FROM students;
```
 - Verify the records:
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

>Delete:` DELETE FROM students WHERE id IN (4, 5, 6);`

>Edit: `UPDATE students SET email = 'kamal@gmail.com' WHERE id = 9;` `UPDATE students SET course = 'Cloud Computing' WHERE id = 8;`

>*Screenshot: Take a screenshot of the MySQL terminal showing the table creation and the `SELECT *` query results [Mandatory].*

**Run a Query:**

2. Under **Scan or query items**, select **Query**.
3. Set the partition key field:
   - Attribute `CourseID`
   - Value `CC101`
4. Click **Run** and review the results - it should return all units under CC101.


**Run a Scan with Filter:**

5. Switch to **Scan** mode.
6. Expand **Filters** and add a filter:
   - Attribute name: `Hours`
   - Condition: **Greater than**
   - Type: **Number**
   - Value: `8`
7. Click **Run** - only items where Hours > 8 should appear (Units with 9 and 10 hours).

**Comparing RDS and DynamoDB**

| Feature | RDS (MySQL) | DynamoDB |
|---|---|---|
| Data model | Relational (tables and rows) | Key value and document |
| Schema | Fixed schema | Flexible schema |
| Query language | SQL | API based (Query and Scan) |
| Scaling | Vertical (instance resize) | Horizontal (automatic) |
| Use case | Complex queries and transactions | High throughput, low latency workloads |
| Managed backups | Yes | Yes (continuous) |
| Pricing model | Instance based | Per request or provisioned |


---

**Results**

 - An RDS MySQL instance was deployed, connected to from an EC2 instance, and populated with student records.
 - SQL queries were executed successfully against a cloud managed relational database.
 - A DynamoDB NoSQL table was created and populated with items using a flexible schema.
 - Both databases were configured with appropriate security settings and backup policies.
 - A clear understanding was established of when each database type is the appropriate architectural choice.

---

**Discussion and Conclusion**

This lab demonstrated the Database as a Service model on AWS. Amazon RDS removed the need to manually install, patch, or back up MySQL by automating those operational tasks entirely. For applications that require complex joins, multi table transactions, and a well defined relational structure, such as enterprise business applications, RDS is the appropriate choice.

DynamoDB offers a serverless, horizontally scalable alternative for applications that need low latency access to semi structured or variable data, including IoT platforms, gaming backends, and mobile applications. Both services address multi-tenant data security through encryption at rest using AWS KMS, network isolation via VPC, and fine-grained access control through IAM policies.

The decision between SQL and NoSQL is an architectural one, driven by data access patterns, consistency requirements, and expected scale. Understanding this distinction is essential when designing cloud native applications.
