# Implementing the MapReduce Programming Model Using Amazon Elastic MapReduce

---

**Objectives**
  - Understand the MapReduce programming model and its phases
  - Set up an Amazon EMR cluster with Hadoop
  - Execute a word count MapReduce job
  - Analyze MapReduce job execution and parallel efficiency
  - Compare MapReduce with traditional sequential processing

---

**Theory**

MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster. It works in three phases:

**Map Phase:** 
  - Input data is split into chunks. Each mapper processes a chunk independently and produces intermediate key value pairs.

**Shuffle and Sort Phase:** 
  - The intermediate key value pairs are grouped by key and forwarded to the appropriate reducers.

**Reduce Phase:** 
  - Each reducer aggregates all values for a given key and produces the final output.

**Parallel Efficiency:** 
  - MapReduce achieves parallelism by distributing map tasks across nodes in the cluster. Efficiency depends on data locality (processing data where it already resides), even partitioning of input splits, and minimizing the volume of data transferred during the shuffle phase.

**Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)** 
  - Is a managed cluster platform that supports big data frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. It handles provisioning, configuration, and tuning automatically, removing most of the operational overhead involved in running a Hadoop cluster.

**Thread vs. Task vs. MapReduce:**

| Model | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Thread Programming | Single machine, shared memory | Requires low level synchronization |
| Task Programming | Single machine, higher level abstraction | Uses schedulers like Java ForkJoin |
| MapReduce | Distributed across machines | Fault tolerant, built for massive datasets |

for line in sys.stdin:
    line = line.strip()
    word, count = line.split('\t', 1)
    count = int(count)

    if current_word == word:
        current_count += count
    else:
        if current_word:
            print(f"{current_word}\t{current_count}")
        current_word = word
        current_count = count

if current_word:
    print(f"{current_word}\t{current_count}")
```

---
**Step 7: View the Output in S3**

1. Go to **S3** -> Navigate to:
   ```
   s3://emr-lab-<your-id>/output/wordcount/
   ```
2. You'll see files like `part-00000`, `part-00001`, and `_SUCCESS`
3. Click *part-00000* -> Click Download
4. Open the file; it should look like:

**Step 9: Run a Comparison with a Larger Dataset** **[Optional]**

**a. Download a Large Text File**

  1. Go to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
  2. Download a plain text book (e.g., *War and Peace* — `.txt` format, ~3MB)

**b. Upload to S3**

  1. Go to your S3 bucket -> `input/` folder
  2. Upload the large `.txt` file (e.g., `war_and_peace.txt`)

**c. Run the Same MapReduce Job**

  1. In EMR Console -> **Steps** tab -> **Add step**
  2. Use the same mapper/reducer, but update:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `WordCount-Large` |
| **Input location** | `s3://emr-lab-<your-id>/input/war_and_peace.txt` |
| **Output location** | `s3://emr-lab-<your-id>/output/wordcount-large/` |

  3. Note the execution time from the Steps tab

**d. Compare Execution Times**

| Job | Input Size | Execution Time |
|---|---|---|
| `WordCount-Job` | ~200 bytes | ~1–2 min |
| `WordCount-Large` | ~3 MB | ~2–4 min |

> EMR's distributed processing means scaling the cluster (more Core nodes) reduces execution time proportionally for large datasets.

---

**Step 10: Terminate the EMR Cluster** 

  - Go to **Amazon EMR** -> **Clusters**
  - Check the checkbox next to `MapReduce-Lab-Cluster`
  - Click **Terminate**
  - If termination protection is **On** -> click **Change** -> turn it **Off** -> then confirm **Terminate**
  - Wait for status to show `Terminated`

> *Always terminate your cluster after the lab to avoid ongoing charges.*

---

**Results**

  - An EMR cluster with two core nodes was successfully provisioned.
  - The Hadoop Streaming MapReduce job executed a word count on the input data.
  - The output correctly computed word frequencies across all input lines.
  - Parallel execution was observed across both map and reduce tasks.
  - The larger dataset test demonstrated the scalability benefit of distributed processing.

**Discussion and Conclusion**

This lab implemented the MapReduce programming model using Amazon EMR. The mapper decomposed input text into key value pairs in the form `(word, 1)`, and the reducer aggregated those pairs to produce a final count for each unique word. Hadoop handled data distribution, fault tolerance, and the shuffle and sort phase transparently.

MapReduce achieves parallel efficiency primarily through data locality: mappers run on the nodes where the data already resides, which reduces network transfer and speeds up execution. Unlike thread programming, which is constrained to a single machine's cores, or task programming, which is limited to a single machine's resources, MapReduce scales horizontally across hundreds of nodes. This makes it well suited for enterprise batch workloads such as log analysis, ETL pipelines, and large scale data aggregation. Amazon EMR reduces the operational burden of running these workloads by automating cluster management entirely.
